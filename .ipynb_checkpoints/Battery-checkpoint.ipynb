    "Lithium-ion batteries power many of today's technologies such as phones, laptops, and electric vehicles. Ensuring that lithium-ion batteries remain cool is critical to ensuring that they remain safe. If the temperature of a lithium-ion battery exceeds 60 degrees celcius, then the battery can start to degrade leading to the release of flammable gases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature of a lithium-ion battery is roughly determined by a balance between the heat that is generated by Joule heating and the heat that is lost into the surrounding environment. The battery temperature can be approximated by the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "T = T_air + (I^2/R)/h,\n",
    "where T_air = 23 degrees celcius is the temperature of the air surrounding the battery, R = 3 x 10^{-4} Ohms is electrical resistance of the battery, I^2 is the current being drawn from the battery, and h = 1.86 x 10^{-4} Watts per degrees celcius is the coefficient of heat transfer between the battery and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will examine the thermal response of a battery to different electrical currents with the aim of determining when the battery will be safe to use."
